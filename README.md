# StarSeer
Uses SFML to model stars on a basic level. Displays their attributes compared to the sun, such as their color, predicted lifespan, size, etc.

One of the first big coding projects I've had as an undergrad (before I knew about git/version control). It's not perfect but I still really like it.
